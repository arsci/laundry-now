# laundry-now

Designed, built, and implemented a commercial-use laundry monitoring system that is non-invasive, easy to install, and easy to operate. The system is intended to allow users to monitor the progress of their laundry from the comfort of their homes on either their mobile devices or computers. This system generates a self-scaling webpage to show users the state of operation that each machine is currently in, along with usage statistics of each machine that management can monitor.
